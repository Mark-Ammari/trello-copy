> Developed a Kanban-like application that will track your progress by utilizing the principles of CRUD.

TrelloCopycat is an application to perform CRUD operations to create, read, update, and delete cards. Used React and Redux to manage state changes throughout the application and Node.js, Express.js, and Firebase to send request to manipulate data in the Backend. Finally, used the Context API from React to change the color scheme of the webpage.
